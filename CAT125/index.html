        <p> My name is Mathew Sanouvong and I aspire to be an amazing UI/UX designer someday....but as of now that dream is at a halt for I am currently unemployed. I study at University of California San Diego where I major in cognitive science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction and minor in design. I am currently seeking employment from any company willing to allow me to practice my skills and teach me more about designing on the digital landscape.       </p>

          <p class="description"> This was an origami website I decided to make in a group of 3 for a class project. We built it all from scratch with HTML and CSS which was our first time working with the language in such a large scope. The final product was never completed but the work to build it taught me a lot about building websites.</p>

          <img src="McDonalds_redesign.png" alt="McDonald's App Redesign">
          <p class="description"> This was a powerpoint presentation for a class I took where I learned about the principles of design. The project had me work in a large group and had us all come up with a redesign for an existing product. The redesigned product was the McDonald's app.
          <br> <br> While this design may be outdated, the fundamentals I learned from this project still persist in my experiences moving foward.</p>
